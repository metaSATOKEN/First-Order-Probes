# algebra: readable frozen experiment

Ordinary source files replace the historical compressed launch format. Scientific members retain their original bytes. The entry defaults to a read-only check; it never starts a simulation or installs dependencies without `--run`.

1. Inspect [bundle_manifest.json](bundle_manifest.json), the sources below, and [settings.json](settings.json).
2. Run `python3 -B lean/experiments/algebra/run_colab.py --check` from the repository root.
3. For an explicitly authorized new/resumed run, upload/unpack the complete repository in Colab, select the original CPU/GPU runtime, and use [run_colab.ipynb](run_colab.ipynb). The start switch defaults to false. Keep Drive unmounted.

[launch_colab.py](launch_colab.py) preserves the original orchestration, reading authenticated source files instead of decompressing embedded code. Restore settings, safety time limits, environment pins, checkpoints and download behavior remain experiment-specific; consult the historical protocol before running. Actual Colab/browser execution has not been retested by this packaging change.

Payload/member identity: `14c40f61942ee407ef417154b7cb0b8cfbc054788d2eae9b75a176b38b394c07`. This is an integrity checksum, not an authorship signature. Historical cell ID: `None`.
